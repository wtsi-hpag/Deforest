===============================

The JSL ('Jack Standard Library') is a set of tools developed by me (Jack Fraser) as a uniform, useful set of boilerplate code I found myself duplicating across numerous C++ projects. It is probably of no use to anyone else, but if you have found your way here, it is probably from one of the projects which utilised this library. 

Even more likely, you are in fact me, reading this a year or two down the line wondering "what on Earth did you do?". If so, I am sorry.
